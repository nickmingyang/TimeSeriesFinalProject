### Introduction
The objective of this analysis is to model and forecast electricity pricing time series data in the Dallas, TX area.
Our client is the Dallas local government, and they have requested the forecasts for economic and infrastructure planning.
The electricity pricing data is from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. We chose to model the data from January 2000 to present. Data from earlier dates had different behavior because it was before Texas deregulated electricity pricing.
This analysis explores the use of univariate and multivariate time series models. The multivariate models include the addition of the variables Dallas temperature, Dallas gasoline prices, and southern urban consumer price index (CPI). These additional variables were obtained from the National Weather Service, the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Univariate methods include various ARIMA models and signal plus noise. Multivariate methods include VAR, neural network (MLP), and ensemble models.
